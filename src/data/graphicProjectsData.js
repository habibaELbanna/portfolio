The transition from vibrant nature to damaged terrain visually represents how small, everyday choices can collectively harm the planet.",
      "The piece combines expressive brushwork with atmospheric lighting to enhance the emotional tone. Subtle textures, layered shading, and controlled color shifts were used to show the contrast between life and decay. The concept emphasizes environmental awareness, urging viewers to consider their footprint and responsibility toward Earth.",
